# Flux Content Builder - Security & Authentication Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Conducted comprehensive audit and one-pass fix of authentication, JWT propagation, and data ownership issues in the Flux Content Builder application.

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Authentication Flow Issues
**Problem:** Inconsistent JWT token propagation to Edge Functions causing 401 errors  
**Root Cause:** Each library was implementing its own auth header logic  
**Fix:** Created centralized `src/lib/invoke.ts` with `invokeWithAuth()` function  
**Impact:** All Edge Function calls now consistently include Bearer tokens

### 2. Database Ownership & RLS Issues  
**Problem:** Missing or incomplete Row Level Security policies; no user onboarding  
**Root Cause:** app_users table missing, incomplete RLS policies  
**Fix:** Added idempotent migration with proper RLS policies for all tables  
**Impact:** All data operations now properly enforce user ownership

### 3. Edge Function Authentication
**Problem:** onboard function not being called reliably after authentication  
**Root Cause:** Missing auth state change handlers  
**Fix:** Updated session store to call onboard on SIGNED_IN/TOKEN_REFRESHED events  
**Impact:** Users are automatically registered in app_users table

### 4. Brand Creation Failures
**Problem:** Brand creation returning 401 Unauthorized  
**Root Cause:** Missing JWT headers in function calls  
**Fix:** Updated brands.ts to use centralized auth function  
**Impact:** Brand CRUD operations now work correctly

### 5. Content Generation Resilience
**Problem:** Hard failures when API keys missing  
**Root Cause:** No fallback handling for missing secrets  
**Fix:** Added graceful degradation with placeholder content  
**Impact:** App remains functional even without all API keys

### 6. Schedule Management
**Problem:** Schedule operations failing with auth errors  
**Root Cause:** Missing JWT propagation  
**Fix:** Updated schedule.ts to use centralized auth  
**Impact:** Scheduling functionality now works correctly

## Files Modified

### Core Infrastructure
- `src/lib/invoke.ts` - NEW: Centralized JWT management
- `supabase/migrations/` - NEW: Idempotent RLS and table setup

### Authentication & Session
- `src/store/session.ts` - Enhanced auth flow with onboard triggers
- `src/components/auth/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Better brand data hydration

### API Integrations  
- `src/lib/brands.ts` - Converted to use centralized auth
- `src/lib/schedule.ts` - Converted to use centralized auth  
- `src/lib/generate.ts` - Converted to use centralized auth

### Edge Functions
- `supabase/functions/generate-image/index.ts` - Added SERVICE_ROLE fallback
- `supabase/functions/health/index.ts` - NEW: Health check endpoint
- `supabase/config.toml` - Ensured all functions have correct JWT settings

### Brand Management
- `src/store/brands.ts` - Better error handling and refresh logic

## Security Improvements

### Row Level Security (RLS)
- ✅ Enabled RLS on all user data tables
- ✅ Created owner-only policies for brands/content/schedules  
- ✅ Added app_users table for user registration tracking

### Authentication Flow
- ✅ Centralized JWT token management
- ✅ Automatic user onboarding on first login
- ✅ Proper email redirect configuration for signup
- ✅ Consistent auth state handling

### Edge Function Security  
- ✅ All protected functions require JWT verification
- ✅ Only worker/health functions are public
- ✅ Proper CORS headers on all functions

## Resilience Improvements

### API Key Management
- ✅ Graceful degradation when optional keys missing
- ✅ Placeholder content instead of hard failures
- ✅ Clear error messages in logs

### Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive try/catch blocks
- ✅ User-friendly error messages
- ✅ Console logging for debugging

## Testing Results

All core user flows now functional:
- ✅ User signup/login with automatic onboarding
- ✅ Brand creation with proper ownership
- ✅ Content generation (with fallbacks)  
- ✅ Schedule management
- ✅ Data visibility (only user's own data)

## Security Warnings Detected

⚠️ **Non-Critical Security Items (User Action Required):**
1. OTP expiry exceeds recommended threshold
2. Leaked password protection disabled

These are configuration items that should be addressed in Supabase Auth settings but don't block core functionality.

## Deployment Status
✅ All changes are production-ready and auto-deployed  
✅ No breaking changes to existing data  
✅ All SQL migrations are idempotent
